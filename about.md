This site is set up as a sample blog for students that like to share their work with others. It uses the Jekyll site generator running on GitHub Pages. The later is offering free-of-charge hosting of static blogs, it is part of the GitHub offering and available by default when you set up a user account with GitHub.

Enjoy.
